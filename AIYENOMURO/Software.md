Software Development Process

Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's
benefits in software development.

1. Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

2. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
Working software over comprehensive documentation;
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and.
Responding to change over following a plan.
