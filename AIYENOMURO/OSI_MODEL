OSI Model
Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

The TCP/IP suite of protocols can be understood in terms of layers (or levels). 
This figure depicts the layers of the TCP/IP protocol. 
From the top they are,
Link layer 
Internet layer 
Transport layer 
Application layer
TCP/IP carefully defines how information moves from sender to receiver.


1. The link layer is the most basic, or lowest-level, classification of communication protocol. 
It deals with sending information between hosts on the same local network, and translating data from the higher layers to the physical layer.

2. Internet layer protocols
Protocols in the Internet layer describe how data is sent and received over the Internet. 
The process involves packaging data into packets, addressing and transmitting packets, and receiving incoming packets of data.


3. Transport layer protocols
Itâ€™s a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that prioritizes reliability over latency, or time. 
TCP describes transferring data in the same order as it was sent, retransmitting lost packets, and controls affecting the rate of data transmission.



4. The application layer describes the protocols that software applications interact with most often. 
The specification includes descriptions of the remote login protocol Telnet, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Also included in the application layer are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its successor, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).
