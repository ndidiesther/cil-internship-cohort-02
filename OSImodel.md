# Describe any layered process you are familiar  with similar to the OSI model.

A layered process similar  to the OSI model am familiar with is the TCP/IP model. 
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a model that helps to determine how computers should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted between them. It shows the  communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
Unlike OSI model, TCP/IP model has four layers which include;
* Application Layer
* Transport Layer 
* Internet Layer
* Network Interface Layer

### Application Layer
Application layer interacts with software applications to implement a communicating component. This layer allows users to interact with other software application.Example of the application layer is an application such as file transfer, email, remote login, etc.

### Transport Layer
Transport layer builds on the network layer in order to provide data transport from a process on a source system machine to a process on a destination system. It is hosted using single or multiple networks, and also maintains the quality of service functions.
It determines how much data should be sent where and at what rate. This layer builds on the message which are received from the application layer. It helps ensure that data units are delivered error-free and in sequence.
Transport layer helps you to control the reliability of a link through flow control, error control, and segmentation or de-segmentation.
The transport layer also offers an acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and sends the next data in case no errors occurred. TCP is the best-known example of the transport layer.

### Internet Internet Layer
An internet layer is a second layer of TCP/IP layes of the TCP/IP model. It is also known as a network layer. The main work of this layer is to send the packets from any network, and any computer still they reach the destination irrespective of the route they take.
The Internet layer offers the functional and procedural method for transferring variable length data sequences from one node to another with the help of various networks.

### Network Interface Layer
This layer is also called a network access layer. It helps you to defines details of how data should be sent using the network.
It also includes how bits should optically be signaled by hardware devices which directly interfaces with a network medium, like coaxial, optical, coaxial, fiber, or twisted-pair cables.
The network Interface layer defines how the data should be sent physically through the network. This layer is responsible for the transmission of the data between two devices on the same network.
