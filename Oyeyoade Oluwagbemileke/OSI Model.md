# OSI MODEL ASSESSMENT

## Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

TCP/IP is a four layered network architecture model similar to the OSI model.

- Application layer.

This is the topmost layer in the model which allows the user to interact with software applications (e.g. web browsers, etc). Some application layer protocols are HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS.

- Transport layer

This is responsible for the reliability, flow control, and correction of data which is being sent over the network. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are protocols used in the transport layer.

- Internet layer

This layer defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network. Examples of protocols at this layer are Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) etc.

- Network Interface layer

This layer corresponds to the combination of the Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model. It defines details of how data should be sent physically through the network.
