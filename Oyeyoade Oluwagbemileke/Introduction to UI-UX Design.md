# Introduction to UI/UX Design Assessment

## UX DESIGN

User experience is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

User Experience or Interface Design (UI/UX Design) are important subsets of UX design. UX design covers a vast array of other areas, too. A UX designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

Products that provide great user experience are designed with not only the product’s consumption or use in mind but also the entire process of acquiring, owning and even troubleshooting it.

UX designers focus on creating products that are usable and other aspects of the user experience (e.g pleasure, efficiency, etc). A good user experience is one that meets a particular user’s needs in the specific context where he/she uses the product.

## Article on UI/UX Fundamentals

User experience (UX) describes the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. It considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It is all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.

The following are the essential elements of the UX Design Process

- Behavior

  UX designers work with people by learning about their habits and goals, needs and constraints, and aligning with existing behaviors to create solutions that are easy to use and solve a real problem. User interviews, task analysis and a Customer journey map are some methods/tools used to learn about user behaviors.

- Strategy

  UX designers create an effective and usable solutions that align both the business and customer goals to a real problem. Strategy in UX is about understanding where an existing product or process can be improved and communicating this effectively to internal teams and external users through responsive design. UX is about design empathy, which means translating user needs into actionable solutions.Strategy is translated into interaction design through artifacts such as user flows, wire-frames and prototypes.

- Usability

  Good design is ultimately determined by usability and accessibility. A design element that does not help the user solve a problem easily is not a good design.Usability is about creating products that anyone can use, especially if they have a disability or impairment. Usability is also about accessibility, which means that physical constraints or disabilities don’t prohibit or impede someone’s use of a product or service.

- Validation
  The UX process emphasizes testing with real users early and often in order to ensure that the design solves the right problem. Smokescreen tests, A/B tests, and Clickable prototype are common methods used to validate ideas through user research.
