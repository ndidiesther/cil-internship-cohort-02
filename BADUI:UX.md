# POOR UI/UX DESIGNS
Having carefully used these websites and Apps I will be mentioning below, I found certains features frustrating and feel the UI/UX designers could have done better. They are mentioned as follow;

### WhatsApp’s delete message feature
From my experience with using WhatsApp: you’re drafting a personal message to send to a close friend on WhatsApp, and you accidentally send it to someone else—perhaps a work contact, or someone you don’t know very well. No problem! Thanks to WhatsApp’s ‘delete for everyone’ feature, you can delete it and pretend like it never happened. Here’s what instead happens when you delete your message, WhatsApp informs the recipient that the sender has deleted a message somewhat defeating the purpose of deleting it in the first place. In fact, this looks way more suspicious and alot of tmes prompt an awkward “why did you delete the message?” type of response. Not good.
Ideally, it should actually delete the message from both ends without the recipient ever knowing you sent a message. For me what they’re doing here is blocking the message instead of deleting it.

### Apple’s storage management system
For some of us using apple phones, we have time-sensitive moments that deserve to be captured on camera so that they can be cherished forever. All of sudden we are confonted with an iOS notification that tells you that your storage is full and you cannot take the photo. What is bad about this UI/UX is that there’s no indication of what the users’ options are here. There should be a clear sense of just how many pictures need to be deleted in order to take a new picture in that moment, or just how much storage needs to be cleared. 

### Fiverr’s 5 star display
Rather than displaying the number of stars in an explicit form, Fiverr has decided opt to representing a 5-star rating with…1 star.At a glance, users  like me who are used to the near-standardization of an explicit amount of stars representing the rating sometimes assume that the product in question only received a 1-star rating. Having a star next to a number for me is not the best UI/UX design.

### Jumia
As a frequuent user of the jumia platform, I have  a problem with the search bar option. Sometimes I see very nice pictures of shirts or shoes from other platforms and I want to look for the products on jumia, it becomes frustrating because I don't know the name of the shirt or shoe. So I just go and type shirt in the search bar and start going through the results with the hope of seeing this particular shirt am looking for. I believe Jumia can have UI/UX design that allow customers to search with images instead of just text. That would really help alot especially to customers like myself.
