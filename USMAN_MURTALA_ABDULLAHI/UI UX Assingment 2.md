My findings

The term &quot;UX&quot; was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple.

A pioneer of user-centered design, Norman emphasized the importance of designing based on the needs and goals of the end user.

In doing so, he introduced the term &quot;user experience&quot;, which, in Norman&#39;s own words, is meant to encompass &quot;all aspects of a person&#39;s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.&quot;

a wireframe is a drawing of a design. Just like architects use blueprints, UX designers use wireframes to communicate their initial design ideas and to demonstrate how the design will function.

Wireframes can be hand-drawn or created on a computer, and are often used when designing digital products. It&#39;s important to note that wireframes focus on the general layout and functionality of the product

How do UX designers and UI designers work together?

It&#39;s important to note that visual design doesn&#39;t typically come under the UX design process; that&#39;s the role of the user interface (UI) designer. So, once I&#39;ve taken care of the layout and information architecture, the UI designer steps in to handle the aesthetics.

UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user&#39;s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user&#39;s visual experience. Based on the UX designer&#39;s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.

So, now we have a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design—time to hand over to the developers!

What is Experience Strategy?

UX design is not just about the user; it also brings huge value to the business providing the product or service. Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer&#39;s needs and those of the company.

If you choose to focus on experience strategy, you might find yourself in the role of UX strategist. UX strategists work closely with both the design team and key business stakeholders (product owners, managers, etc.); it&#39;s their job to make sure that everyone is serving the right users while simultaneously aligning with the strategic goals of the business. In short, UX strategists see to it that all the moving parts of a business work together in harmony.

What is User Research?

You may remember from the previous tutorial that user research is a crucial component of the UX design process. Indeed, all UX designers must master the art of user research—and some will even choose to specialize in this area.

As the job title suggests, UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users. As a UX research specialist, you can expect to work closely with the product team to identify research questions, to plan and lead user research sessions (such as interviews, surveys, usability tests, etc.), and to share your insights in order to inform the product strategy. Some additional roles often associated with the user research quadrant include usability analyst and research analyst.

What is Information Architecture?

Information architecture is the science of organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly way. If you&#39;re designing a website or app, the information architecture has a huge impact on how easy it is to navigate—so, as a UX designer, you&#39;ll need to understand the principles of IA.

If you decide to specialize in this aspect of UX, you could end up working as an information architect. Information architecture has roots in both cognitive psychology and library science—you can think of information architects as user-centric digital librarians! As an information architect, you may be responsible for assessing the IA of an existing product, planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labelling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies.

What is Interaction Design?

Interaction design focuses on how a user interacts with specific elements of a digital product. This quadrant looks at the structure and behaviour of interactive systems, and how they can be designed and optimized for human use.

Interaction designers answer questions like: &quot;What happens when a user clicks a button?&quot; or &quot;How will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app?&quot; Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.

Based on the quadrant model, we&#39;ve touched upon a few of the specialist routes you might take as a UX designer. But that&#39;s just the beginning! Let&#39;s explore some additional career paths that fall under the UX umbrella…
