UI/UX

User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.

User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

The five main principles of UX design

There are many important principles within UX design but to simplify things a bit, we&#39;ve broken them down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation.

Empathy

Quality UX design puts users&#39; needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user&#39;s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.

Strategy

Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

Usability

In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. The last thing a user wants is to feel like ordering food delivery on their phone is equivalent to completing a 1000 piece puzzle. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.

Inclusivity

A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is &quot;design for all&quot;—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.

Exemplary UX design incorporates the experience and needs of under-represented or oppressed groups of people and can even find solutions for their unique problems.

Validation

However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.
