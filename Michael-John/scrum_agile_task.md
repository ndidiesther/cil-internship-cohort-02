# DAY 6- TASK
1.	## Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's
## benefits in software development.

### Attempt
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
1.	A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2.	The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3.	The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4.	Repeat.
So, in summary three personalities make up Scrum: 
- Product Owner
- Scrum team and
- Scrum master.

In software development, Scrum can be likened to developers coming together to achieve a common goal or to address complex problems

### Advantages of Scrum
1. Adaptability and Flexibility
Scrum framework is one of the most flexible frameworks which is always ready for changes and can adapt to any type of situation. 
2. Innovation and Creativity
When there is a competitive world out there, it is the best company that brings out the most innovative products according to the needs of the customer, that survives. Everybody wants the best product for the price they pay and the company must fulfill the needs of the customer and satisfy them. This requires a great deal of creativity and innovation which the Scrum team has to display by coming up with excellent ideas. Scrum promotes an Agile mindset and an environment that encourages ideas from everyone on the team and helps them discuss the ideas such that the business value can be maximized and the best products can be delivered. 
3. Time-to-Market
Scrum creates product increments in Sprints which is about 1-4 weeks. This helps the Developers stay relevant to the market and develop products that are trending. 
4. Lower Prices
Implementation of Scrum in the organization helps the company to reduce costs in the project in various ways such as:
- Unnecessary documentation and control requirements help to reduce overhead significantly.
- Enhanced productivity of the Scrum team
5.	Better Quality
Quality has always been the main priority in Scrum as the products developed using Scrum framework display high value. The Developers in the Scrum Team take full ownership of the product being developed and work in a self-organizing team.

### Disadvantages of Scrum
1. Scrum requires skills and training
A considerable amount of training is required to understand the process in Scrum such that the companies successfully implement it.
2. Scrum requires transformation at the level of organization
If a company has to achieve success by using Scrum, the changes are required from an organizational level. This requires the business users to work together and collaborate with the Developers in the spirit. This requires the organizational barriers to be removed which is difficult or impossible to occur. 
3. Difficult to Scale large and complex projects
Scrum is meant for medium and small-scale businesses and there may be instances where it cannot be implemented in large and complex projects. The scalability of Scrum is an issue for enterprises adopting it at organizational levels.
4. Not Suitable for Plan-driven Approach projects
Scrum is designed for products that do not require more planning and strategies before the development process. It believes that customer feedback and other factors could be used and the process of the product development could be figured out. However, Scrum may not be the best solution for a plan-driven approach to complete projects. 

## Question 2
### From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan.
