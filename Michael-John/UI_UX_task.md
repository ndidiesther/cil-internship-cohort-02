User experience gives a summary of the experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.
UX isn’t limited to the digital space. Anything that can be experienced can be designed.
User experience design considers each and every element that shapes the user experience.
Humans can only benefit from a product if it is user friendly. Hence, the aim of UX designers is to bridge the gap between the product and the human user. 

A good UX design requires analysis of past experiences, researching new practices, interviewing real or potential users, and testing, test designs.
There are good UX design and there are bad UX is designs.
A UX design that does not easily solve human problems is a bad UX design.

2.	#### Write an article on UI/UX Fundamentals, submit as a markdown file in your student folder, raise a PR.

UI/UX DESIGN – THE BASICS
UI design entails building interfaces in software or computerized devices with core focus on looks or style. The access point through which users interact or communicate with designs are called user interfaces.

Characteristics of a good UI design
- It is easy to use
- It is pleasurable

UI is more focused on surface and overall feel of a design. In order words, it considers basically, looks and feels. UI deals with a product’s look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product. UI is strictly a digital term.
UX design on the other hand considers the entire spectrum of the user experience. UX is the entire process used in creating or developing products that make meaning and that is relevant to users. This process entails:
1.	Product acquisition and integration
2.	Branding
3.	Design
4.	Usability
5.	Function

UX is a story that begins before the device of product gets to the user’s hand. UX design is focused on creating products that are:
1.	Usable
2.	Pleasurable
3.	Efficient
4.	Fun to use.

Every user has particular need. If as UX designer, you are able to meet this need, then you are a good UX designer.
A UI designer thinks about:
- Typography
- Icons
- Buttons
- Color
- Schemes
- Spacing etc.
Whereas, a UX designer thinks about:
- User research
- Creating personas
- Designing wireframes
- Interactive prototypes
- Testing designs

I see UX as the human skeleton and the organs in the body whereas, I see UI as the skin covering the human skeleton and all the aesthetics on it.

I see UX as the skeletal part of a cushion chair, whereas i see UI as the clothing that beautifies  the chair.

UI and UX work hand in hand.
When a product looks great but is difficult to use, that product has a great UI and a poor UX.
When a product is very usable, but looks terrible, it has a great UX and a poor UI.
A good UI can never make up a bad UX. When it comes to product design, UX and UI complement each other
