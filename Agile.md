## Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a "process" framework that compromises spliting a total process into bits thats are executed intermittently for more precision and perfection by group of team members. It allows for team splitting into smaller groups whom work on deliverable, prioritized sections of the splitted process, it also contains daily meetings to discuss the whole workdone, obstacles met and plans for the day. At the end of each interval, the results are integrated into the whole system till the process is complete for the whole system.

* Clarity in goals - Developers know what to do within the timed period.

*  Team cohesiveness
*  On-time Delivery -  Communication and feedback within the sprint allow team members to identify issues and to collaborate internally and externally which enables developers to meet on time.
