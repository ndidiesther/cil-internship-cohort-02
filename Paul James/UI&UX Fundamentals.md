## WHAT IS UI/UX AND DESIGN
User Interface (UI) Design is a link between users and the website, app or any other digital platforms. It includes basic design element that need to be present in order for someone to navigate the website or app
and makes decisions.
There are elements involved in User interface which are as follows;
- Input controls: checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, list boxes, buttons, toggles, text fields, date field.
- Navigational components: breadcrumb, slider, search field, pagination, slider, tags, icons.
- Informational components: tooltips, icons, progress bar, notifications, message boxes, modal windows.
- Containers: Accordion. This is a vertically stacked list of items that utilizes show/ hides functionality.
When a label is clicked, it expands the section showing the content within. They can have one or more items showing at a time and may have default states that reveal one or more sections without the user clicking.
User Interface design is a way you design your website from backend so that your audience can have a seamless, and enjoyable front-end technology experience.
The following are list of thing to consider to have a good UI design;
- Easily navigable menus
- Simple design
- Usability Testing
- Be consistent
- Communication is key

### WHAT IS UX DESIGN
User experience design, or UXD, considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It’s all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency. UX designers look to bridge the gap between the product and the human user. They think about how people interact with a given product, and look for ways to make these interactions as intuitive and straightforward as possible.
#### UX DESIGN PROCESS
What does a UX designer actually do? This question comes up time and time again, especially among those considering a career in UX! As a UX designer, what you do can vary dramatically from project to project. UX design process can generally be divided into four key phases: research, design, testing, and implementation.
# User Research
As a UX designer, a user-centered approach is absolutely crucial; you need to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave. It’s therefore really important to engage with your users directly and figure out how they tick!
Research is essential as it helps you understand the problem you’re trying to solve. It enables you to identify pain-points and challenges, validate or invalidate your assumptions, find patterns and commonalities across your target user groups, and shed plenty of light on your users’ needs and objectives.
# User Research Analysis
Having conducted extensive user research, it’s time to analyze your findings and turn them into meaningful insights. In other words, what does the data tell you about the product you’re designing and the people you’re designing it for? 
One of my favorite research analysis techniques is affinity mapping. All you need is a whiteboard or a blank wall and some Post-it notes. On each Post-it note, you write down an observation or quote from your research, before grouping your Post-its into similar clusters. The end result is a wall or whiteboard filled with sticky notes and, most importantly, themes that can be used to draw meaningful insights from your data.
# User personas & user flows
A user persona is a fictional but realistic representation of a set of target users based on their goals, needs, and behaviors (all discovered during the research phase!).A user persona is an extremely valuable tool in the UX design process as it reminds designers and other stakeholders that they’re designing for real people. This helps the designer to build empathy with the user and to prioritize key features and design decisions based on real user data.
# Wireframes & prototypes
Once the steps in the user journey have been mapped out, I can start to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that’s intuitive and easy for the user to navigate.
A wireframe is like a blueprint, demonstrating the layout of the design and how it will function. Wireframes and prototypes tend to start off as rather basic, low-fidelity sketches, and then, based on feedback and initial testing, will evolve into detailed mockups that closely resemble the final design.
# User testing
Testing is a fundamental part of the UX designer’s job, and a core component of the overall UX design process. Just like user research, it’s important to test your designs on real users; this way, you get authentic feedback from those who will actually be using the product.

#### BENEFITS OF A UI/UX DESIGN
Technological advances in the 21st-century have never been faster. Everyone wants to experience and have the best technology while at the same time not wasting any precious time. The same thing applies when it comes to checking out websites or mobile applications. Here, users are especially impatient. Anytime a page doesn’t load fast enough or an application takes too long to open, users will be left frustrated. As a result, they will not pursue their intentions.

This could be bad news for brands and businesses with an active online presence. It could damage their reputation and even severely impact their marketing strategies and revenue. This all points to the importance of a well-designed UI/UX. Below are some examples of the benefits UI/UX design have on enterprises.
- Improves customer acquisition
Customer acquisition simply refers to getting new customers. The process involves convincing or persuading customers that a company’s product or service is worth their hard-earned money. Businesses and organizations use customer acquisition costs as an important benchmark when it comes to evaluating the value customers bring to their business. Customer acquisition requires a lot of planning and strategizing.
A strong and valuable user experience offers a business a strong competitive advantage in attracting and retaining their customers. 
- Helps with customer retention
The same with customer acquisition, customer retention also requires a lot of strategy and forethought. The strategies used to keep customers should enable the business to provide and get value from their existing customer base. It’s important that businesses invest as much effort in keeping their customers as they do to acquire them. Simply put, customer acquisition creates a strong foundation of customers.Customer retention strategies are how a business builds strong relationships with customers, at the same time maximizing revenue from them.
- Optimizes development time and cost
Everyone knows that a well-designed app or site just…works. And it’s easy to tell which ones are poorly designed and which ones have been developed with careful planning and consideration. People hate using apps that are buggy, crashes frequently, and with a dated design.
Similarly, as a website that’s confusing to navigate, using poor typography, and disjointed color schemes are going to have a high bounce rate. All these reasons point to the need for brands and businesses to tap a professional web design agency.
-  Increased productivity
Today, almost all businesses need an interface that’s cohesive enough that can help their organization market its products and services to earn a profit. In order to develop a solution using simple yet effective user experience and design can help to inspire employees to work with enthusiasm and gusto.
A great UI/UX system can also lessen errors and promote a smoother workflow for employees. An effective tip in this regard would be using light colors and highlighting relevant content so that users can see the important information at a glance. This will help them focus on the most pertinent information without getting distracted.
-  More user engagement
More than goals, funnels, and calls-to-action, if your visitors don’t engage with your website or app, it would be pointless to pursue all those other strategies. It is, therefore, a priority for all UI/UX designers to prioritize user engagement and use it to inform their design and style choices.

A tip-in improving user engagement through UI/UX design is by being instructive. It’s helpful and beneficial for a site to be direct and clear about what the site or page is meant to do and that should take precedence over a complicated design that looks cool or interesting.
