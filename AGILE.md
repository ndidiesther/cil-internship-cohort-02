# 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

Basically;
* Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. a product backlog. The team meets to discuss:
- The backlog.
- What still needs to be completed.
- How long it will take.
* Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints:
- Sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done.
- A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.
- The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.
- Each sprint ends with a sprint review.
- Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which starts a new sprint.
- Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.
* In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans for that day.
- The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes.
- Each team member needs to be present and prepared.
- The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.

### Scrum Benefits in software development
1. With Scrum work is done by the development team simultaneously rather than sequentially. Programmers code “on the fly” and do not wait until all questions are answered and everything is crystal clear before they start to program. Everything is flexible and changeable during the life of the project and even after. The same is true of testing code which is constantly done and not just at the end after all coding has been completed.
2. With Scrum there is adaptability. Changes can be supported and integrated into a project currently in progress. Under Scrum the scope of the project (what is to be done) is variable but time and cost are constant. This is a major difference with the traditional approach where the scope is constant ( no changes allowed, or if they are, reluctantly) but time and cost are variable.
3. With Scrum, tasks are prioritized by order of importance and this usually means that tasks to be completed first will probably affect return on investment the most. By releasing “done” chunks of prioritized work in a sprint, portions of your product is on the market faster than in traditional projects where completed work is released in total at the end of the project.
4. With Scrum the development team is key. The members, usually five to nine people, interface closely and have the motto “all for one and one for all”. Their main goal in a given sprint is to complete as soon as possible useable segments of prioritized work that will have business value. Helping out where needed doing any job, the team as a whole is responsible for what is required. In Scrum pair programming is encouraged; the idea being two heads are better than one. This results in faster coding completion time with better quality.
5. Because a Scrum team does not have a boss to tell them what to do and when they identify more with the project as their own. This helps boost their morale. They also have a ScrumMaster, who mentors and protects them from outside negative pressure. Also because of techniques like pair programming, their rate of increased knowledge is greater than it would be if they coded alone. For all of these reasons morale and job satisfaction is higher.
6. With projects run using the Agile/Scrum approach, there also is greater customer/user satisfaction. A key reason for this is that the users are getting useable portions of completed product quicker. They can then try out what they received and report back their findings. This is a critical factor in the overall success of the project. Certain previously submitted requests may no longer be required in which case unnecessary work will be saved and the overall project can be brought in sooner than originally scheduled. Or, the user may find changes are needed to his or her original request for work to be done. If this occurs there should be no problem as Scrum is designed for adaptability and to incorporate change expeditiously.

# 2. From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following:
Individuals and interactions over ..... 
Working software over .....
Customer collaboration over .....
Responding to change over ......

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
