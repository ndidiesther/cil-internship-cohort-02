# ARTICLE ON UX/UI FUNDAMENTAL
UI/UX are the two words used interchangeably, but means very different things. So, in this article we going to be looking at the fundamentals of each of them.
# UX DESIGN
UX design, or user experience design, is the process of creating products and experiences that help users get done what they’ve come to do—as efficiently and effectively as possible. Now the next question that will reading in our is what is user experience?

user experience is how users feel as they engage with your product. This concept applies to physical objects and daily experiences, like using a coffee maker or buying a car at a dealership; but it also applies to the digital side of life—think about the last time you transferred money using a banking app, purchased something online, or even played a game on your phone.

After we have known what user design and user experience are, we will look at what they do
# WHAT UX DESIGNER DOES
This process begins with empathy. UX designers connect with users and seek to understand what makes them tick, as well as what they really need from this product or experience. That’s called user research and it comprises the bulk of the empathize stage of the process.

The next stage is to clearly define what problems, needs, and goals users have that the product could potentially solve or help users achieve. This leads naturally into the ideation stage, when UX designers actively come up with feasible solutions to the problems they’ve defined. This ideation can take many forms, but it’s not unlike brainstorming ideas for classes, projects, and lesson plans.

In the prototyping stage, UX designers take their solutions and build them into a functioning model so they can share the ideas with stakeholders and test the solutions to make sure they’ll actually work. And that’s the final stage of the process: testing to make sure that the solutions they’ve arrived at will actually improve the user experience.
# UX DESIGNER CORE SKILLSET
A great UX designer can connect and communicate with a broad variety of audiences (internal and external to the organization and the design process).

UX designers are also fluent in a variety of tools and processes involved in user research, usability testing, communication and project management, visual design, wireframing, and prototyping

# UI DESIGN
User interface (UI) design refers to the visual design of a product’s digital interface, such as an app screen or website. It’s the process of designing the visual and interactive properties of a visual experience, ensuring the interface is both clear for the user to navigate and overall aesthetically pleasing. UI design is a multidisciplinary field involving various elements from visual design, UX design, and graphic design. 

# THINGS UI DESIGNERS DOES
UI designers are responsible for ensuring the product’s interface is visually stimulating, easy to navigate, and in line with business goals. They’re also responsible for establishing visual consistency across a digital product through creating style guides and UI pattern libraries.

UI designers often work closely with user experience (UX) designers throughout the digital design process. While UX focuses on the optimization of a product for practical use, UI design is all about a product’s look and feel. UI designers will take the foundations laid by the UX designer—the wireframes, user mapping, and information architecture—and bring everything to life with a gorgeous color palette, typography, and shapes. 

In order to design user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, UI designers keep accessibility and inclusivity in their mind at all times. They’re constantly weighing up each design choice and what it means for the end-user. UI design is all about detail, and UI designers have the complex task of considering all the visual aspects of the user’s journey, including all the individual screens and touchpoints that the user might encounter, from tapping a button to scrolling down a page

# Important skills and trait for a UI designer to have
-	Collaboration and communication. UI designers rarely work in isolation—you’ll collaborate closely with UX designers, product managers, developers, and content / UX writers, so interpersonal skills are a must!
- Proficiency in popular industry-standard tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, and In Vision
-	A certain degree of tech know-how. In addition to working with computer-based tools, UI designers must understand how their designs will operate on different platforms, devices, and screen sizes. It’s therefore useful to be a little tech savvy (especially when liaising with developers)
-	An interest in people and human behavior. UI design ties in closely with user experience, so the best UI designers work with empathy, keeping humans at the forefront
