#### QUESTION 1

# What is Scrum?
In software development, Scrum is a or methodology that is used to efficiently produce quality work while adapting quickly to change. It provides an over-arching conceptual model on top of which one can add the working methods that function best for the unique circumstances. 

The Scrum framework defines three key aspects of the software development team:

1.	Roles and Responsibilities
2.	Events
3.	Artifacts

### Scrum Theory 

The scrum framework is founded on the core concept of Empiricism, which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and supports an evidence-based decision-making process that derives wisdom past successes and failures. 

The iterative, incremental approach that characterizes scrum projects helps make projects more predictable and reduce the risk of project failure. Empirical process control relies on three qualities that form the three pillars of the scrum framework.
The Three Pillars of Scrum
 
#### Transparency
Members of the scrum team must collaborate effectively to ensure that project stakeholders share the same vision for the project and maintain visibility of the project's current issues and status. The key to transparency is establishing a common understanding.

#### Inspection
The iterative and incremental approach to scrum projects encourages members of the development team to perform frequent inspections of their work and the work of other team members, checking for errors and working to detect undesirable deviations from project requirements.

#### Adaptation
The concept of adaptation is similar to that of change management or corrective actions in the context of quality control processes. When a product is created that does not conform to the specified requirements, the process or materials must be adjusted to minimize further deviation and correct the deviation before it negatively impacts the end-user. Inspection and adaptation are formally conducted through the four scrum events.

### Four Scrum Events
The scrum framework for application delivery is based around sprints. A sprint is a fixed duration of time during which the scrum team attempts to deliver a specified feature or set of work. There are four major events that take place in the scrum framework and all of them are organized around the sprint.

#### Planning Sprints in the Scrum Framework
Each sprint is a time-boxed event - it lasts only a specific duration and then it is finished. Sprint planning, therefore, deals with two important questions:

1.	What can be delivered during the upcoming sprint?
2.	How will the scrum team work together to deliver this work in the upcoming sprint?

#### Daily Scrum Meetings
The daily scrum meeting is meant to occur in a 15-minute time-box that cannot be exceeded. This meeting may be called a "scrum" but the term "stand-up" is also popular. A stand-up meeting is intentionally kept short by having attendees stand up and talk instead of sit around a table in a meeting room. Daily scrum meetings are meant to deal with immediate problems, address objectives and challenges for the day and to ensure that the team is on track to meet its sprint target.

#### Sprint Review
The sprint review is one of the most formalized processes of the Scrum framework. The purpose of the sprint review is to assess and update scrum artifacts and collaborate to determine the next steps.

#### Sprint Retrospective
The purpose of a sprint retrospective is to analyze the performance of the scrum team over the past sprint and identify any opportunities for improvement that could lead to better results in the future.

### Three Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts exist to help ensure project transparency and drive information flow throughout the scrum team. There are three important scrum artifacts of which practitioners should be aware.

#### Product Backlog
The product backlog is a comprehensive to-do list for the project. It contains a detailed list of all requirements and all changes that must be made to the product in future releases.

#### Sprint Backlog
The sprint backlog contains all of the product backlog items that were selected to be completed in a sprint. These items are the highest priority items for that sprint, as identified by the product owner.

#### Increment
If the product backlog is a to-do list for the project, the increment is a list of all items on that list that have been checked off. Items in the Increment must be marked as "done" according to the scrum team's shared definition of what constitutes a finished release.


## BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

### Simultaneous and Sequential work
With Scrum work is done by the development team simultaneously rather than sequentially. Programmers code and do not wait until all questions are answered and everything is clear before they start to program. Everything is flexible and changeable during the life of the project and even after.

### Adaptability
With Scrum there is adaptability. Changes can be supported and integrated into a project currently in progress. Under Scrum the scope of the project (what is to be done) is variable but time and cost are constant. This is a major difference with the traditional approach where the scope is constant ( no changes allowed, or if they are, reluctantly) but time and cost are variable.

### Prioritization
With Scrum, tasks are prioritized by order of importance and this usually means that tasks to be completed first will probably affect return on investment the most. By releasing “done” chunks of prioritized work in a sprint, portions of your product is on the market faster than in traditional projects where completed work is released in total at the end of the project.

### Development Team
With Scrum the development team is key. The members, usually five to nine people, interface closely and have the motto “all for one and one for all”. Their main goal in a given sprint is to complete as soon as possible useable segments of prioritized work that will have business value. Helping out where needed doing any job, the team as a whole is responsible for what is required. In Scrum pair programming is encouraged; the idea being two heads are better than one. This results in faster coding completion time with better quality.

### Good Morale
Because a Scrum team does not have a boss to tell them what to do and when they identify more with the project as their own. This helps boost their morale. They also have a Scrum Master, who mentors and protects them from outside negative pressure. Also because of techniques like pair programming, their rate of increased knowledge is greater than it would be if they coded alone. For all of these reasons morale and job satisfaction is higher.

### Costumer/User Interface
With projects run using the Agile/Scrum approach, there also is greater customer/user satisfaction. A key reason for this is that the users are getting useable portions of completed product quicker. They can then try out what they received and report back their findings. This is a critical factor in the overall success of the project. Certain previously submitted requests may no longer be required in which case unnecessary work will be saved and the overall project can be brought in sooner than originally scheduled. Or, the user may find changes are needed to his or her original request for work to be done. If this occurs there should be no problem as Scrum is designed for adaptability and to incorporate change expeditiously.

# AGILE MANIFESTO

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools; 
* Working software over comprehensive documentation; 
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation;
* Responding to change over following a plan.
