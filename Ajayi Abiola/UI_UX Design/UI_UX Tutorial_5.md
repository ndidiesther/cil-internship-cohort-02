# PORTFOLIO 1

### I am currently reviewing the Portfolio of Tori which I got from Bestfolios. 

The link to the portfolio is provided here https://torisgarro.github.io/index.html

On the landing page, there is a quick introduction and a short mention of what she does, there is no picture of her, so I might check the about page for that. In addition, there is no clear call to action on the landing page however; there are blocks of previous work that are clickable. 

Moving to the About page, I can see that the page is not detailed enough.

Firstly, I have forgotten her name, so I will refer back to the landing page for that information.

Secondly, there are no information about her skills and her qualifications which I think is the essence of the about page. 

In conclusion, there is no indication that she wants to connect with potential partners in both the landing page and the about page.

To the case study of SUBSCRIBER NEWSTELLERS

Link: https://torisgarro.github.io/projects/atlantic-subscriber-newsletters.html

There is a defined problem in the case study which tells us the pain point and the need for the project. Also, there are reference to the team members she worked with.

However, there is no mention of tools and technique used during this project. Also, there is no explanation of the discovery phase, however, there is a little insight to how the problem is approached.

There is a mention of the outcome of the project and how it helped the business was explained.


# PORTFOLIO 2

### Now, I am reviewing the Portfolio of Rahul Jain also from Bestfolios. 

The link to the portfolio is provided here https://rahuljain.co/index.html

On the landing page, there is a calm and welcoming feel to the page. Introduction was concise. In addition, there is clear call to action on the landing page which says ‘My Story’. 

Clicking on the ‘my story’ link, we got to the About page. The page is detailed enough and I feel like I know Jain enough from the information in this page.

The page reminded me his name and it also emphasizes what he does, what drives him and what is important to him.

Furthermore, his education, work experience and award and recognition were listed on the page. However, I would have loved to see more about his skills which are related to his job. There is contact information on the page which shows willingness for collaboration.

On the downside, he doesn’t have any case study to show which might be frowned upon by potential partners.
