# TASK 3

 
## Jeff Gothelf

I will classify Jeff Gothelf into the Experience strategy quadrant. 

Going through his blogs, books and website, including his personal profile, I realize that he is a leader who speaks about how other leaders should inspire and collaborate with their team in order to drive agility and innovation.

Jeff Gothelf is a true agility expert and a consultant. He worked with management to evolve agility thinking in organization. He provided the ground for improved cross-functional collaboration and outcome orientation.

## Yael Levey,

I will also classify Yael Levey into the Experience strategy quadrant. 

Less than a minute looking through her website, I already fell in love with her. She’s funny and have her way with words. There is no doubt that she is a great designer. 

As at the time of filling this report, she works at Facebook as a product design manager. Most of her blog posts are tailored towards getting the best out of your team. She wrote a blog about how some companies under appreciate the designers and how this can lead to under productiveness.

This shows that’s she’s deals more with the business side of things as a UX designer and it is evident in her job title in Facebook as a Product design manager.

## Sarah Doody

I will also classify Sarah Doody into the UX research quadrant. 

According to her website, here is what she has to say; “I help companies and teams understand the people and purpose behind the products they are creating. Since 2004 I’ve been leveraging the power of storytelling and research to help teams reduce the risk of re-work and instead, build the right products and features the first time around.”

She is passionate about user research and how this helps the team to create the right product from the start.
