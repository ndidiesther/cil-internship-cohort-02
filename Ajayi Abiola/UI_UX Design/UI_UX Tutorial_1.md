# TASK 1


## CHIPPER CASH

I love the app and its cool user interface, Transactions are quite smooth and the app is super easy to use. Also, they have great and active support team.

But I have few issues with the app.

Firstly, the transaction histories are too public; I remember trying to prevent an overbearing friend from seeing my previous transactions when logging into the app and all I could do was to pretend like I couldnâ€™t remember my password. I think there should be a page that houses the transactions, something like a "transaction history page", where you can securely view your previous transactions keeping it away from prying eyes, unlike the way they just appear on the main page after login.

In addition, after performing a financial transaction such as cashing out to a bank account, there should be a better reward like a printable receipt that shows the details of the transaction. This can be used as a proof of payment to the recipient while waiting for the arrival of the transfer. 

Finally, there should be a way to remove some of the beneficiary account details in the app, as this can help prevent cashing out to the wrong account details.

## CAMSCANNER

It is a good app overall. Disappointing part for me is in the use experience. For instance, one can get lost trying to rename a file or even creating a folder.

The water mark that can be removed by payment is another drawback. It is very expensive and it a monthly enrollment plan.
I bought the full version several years ago, however the app won't stop pushing advertisement notifications for subscriptions and upgrades. So displeased with this that it caused me to find alternate options.

## PIGGYBANK

It is wonderful app, makes saving easier and rewarding. It's being a great experience. Transactions are treated swiftly and they never miss a due date. 

However, I have tried setting the app to automatically save money from bank account but it is not working, it shows it's on auto-save mode but I have to transfer manually. Sometimes, it will save some days and skip some other days.

In addition, my saving is supposed to be a secret, only open to me. With the fingerprint feature, anyone can just take my phone and open the app and find out the amount I am saving. it's just like someone having access to my local saving box.

I will also suggest the following to make the user experience a lot better:

1.	Create a live customer care chat channel maybe a WhatsApp platform; 
2.	There should be a notification when there is a free opportunity to invest preferably via the app or push notification rather than email only.
