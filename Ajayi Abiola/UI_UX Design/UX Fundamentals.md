# UI/UX Fundamentals

## What is UX?

UX design is essential to creating usable and desirable products that help companies, consumers, and even whole societies find solutions to difficult or troubling problems.

A user is a person who purchases or interacts with a product, digital interface, or service. Therefore, a user experience (UX) is the series of events that occur when the user actually uses the product.

And UX design is the process of discovering user needs and designing solutions to meet them.

UX designers take into account many things when crafting a good user experience, not just aesthetics or impressive visuals. They must consider the usability and accessibility of the product, as well as a variety of design principles, usability heuristics, and information architecture. 

## The five main principles of UX design

There are many important principles within UX design, and are broken down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation.

### Empathy

Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.

### Strategy

A crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

### Usability

A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.

### Inclusivity

Design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.

### Validation

One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.


## What do UX designers do?

UX designers complete tasks like user research, usability testing, sketching wireframes and prototypes, running focus groups, or presenting their work to stakeholders.

The UX design process include:

### Empathize

Empathy is key—and user research is essential to finding that understanding and connection to the users’ needs and goals. So the first step is to conduct extensive and inclusive research about the people who will be interacting with the product. There are many ways designers can learn about their users. Here are a few:
* Surveys
* Interviews
* Focus groups
* Observation
* Ethnographic field studies
* Analytics
* Eye tracking
* Customer feedback
* Desirability studies

### Define

After understanding the users’ needs and goals, UX designers figure out and define what problems need solving, and set direct guidelines for the tasks ahead.

Here UX designers get a clear idea of the project their client or employer has for them and what the goals for the business are. Designers may also collaborate with their design teams and come up with an effective approach to creating design solutions.

Once designers have a comprehensive idea of their users, they’ll present their findings in the form of a user persona—an archetypical person that represents the needs and behaviors of the larger population. They may also come up with a user journey map to visually represent the ideal customer experience.

### Ideate

This stage often happens recursively throughout the defining, prototyping, and even testing stages—you discover user needs and your imagination starts coming up with ways to solve those problems! But skilled UX designers also know how to come up with ideas in systematic ways. Ideation often happens, then, in a design thinking workshop. 

### Prototype

Designers create mockups and prototypes to initially test their ideas to make sure they’ll actually work as intended. In later stages, UXers create wireframes to ensure that the ideas are translated well from design to development—and then out into the world and in the hands of users.

### Test

UX design process is not complete without testing the design solutions to ensure that they’ll actually work the way it is intend! So, now that a design has been created, it’s time to test that design against actual users with usability testing. Designers will observe their users interact with their designs and ask them to complete certain tasks or sort information. They take note of the user’s emotions, body language, statements, frustrations, and difficulties they have when using the product. After testing, designers compile the data, analyze it, and determine what improvements need to be made.

### Iterate

The UX design process is a cyclical one meaning that once the designs have been created and user feedback has been obtained, it’s time to repeat the steps again. With each cycle of the design process, designers take what they’ve learned from previous ones and address new problems, make meaningful improvements, and design more effective solutions. Even after product release, designers will continue to obtain user feedback and iterate upon their original designs.
