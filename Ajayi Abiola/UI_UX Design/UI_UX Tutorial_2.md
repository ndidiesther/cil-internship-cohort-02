# Relationship between UX processes and my current job

In relation to the UX design process, I can find some similarities.

First, student research. Before I can start teaching the student, I need to know a few things about such student. I ask questions like:

* What is your name?
* Where are you from?
* People say chemistry is a difficult subject, what do you think?
* How many hours do you commit to reading per day? And so on?

These questions are aimed to know the strength and weaknesses of the student. This will help me develop a customized lesson scheduled for such private student.

The approach is a little different for a class with more students. The purpose of the first session will be to get a general idea of the level of understanding of the students concerning the subject of interest.

After this, Student analysis, I will then get back to the coordinator to discuss my findings. The report will include; 

* My view about the strength of the student(s),  
* My proposed pace of the class, i.e. how fast I will be able to load them with information, 
* How often the class session should be, how often the students should be tested, etc.

Next step is to use the information to plan a lecture note or adjust the current lecture note I use. This will be based on the level and strength of the students. The best way to teach is to be able to relate each concept to real life situations.

After this, Prototyping, we take the class sessions and I watch out for things like the attention span of the students, the quickness of grapping information and so on.

Next is to Test the students after a few lesson sessions. The result will give insight into how well the student is getting the lessons taught. 

Repeat. The information will also be used to circle back on the information gathered initially and repeat the circle before the next testing.
