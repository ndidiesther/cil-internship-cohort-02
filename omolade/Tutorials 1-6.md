**TUTORIAL 1**

a website i visit frequently: Jumia.com

I dont like:

- That for every product purchase, the user has to fill a destination over again, there is is no option of using a previous destination only a new destination.
- Its a hassle finding the checkout option, one has to put in a cart first.
- No option to buy a product directly on the product viewing page.

I like:

- specifications for each products are known.
- The ease of searching of products using key word.
- The use of sliders to show price range because it streamline and makes the search of a product easier according to budget.

ChipperCash App
Dislikes:
-The button to add cash and remove cash is mostly unresponsive 
-Verification of a user should be fast but it takes a long period for verfication to be accepted
-The add card details section goes on and off and at times its missing.


**TUTORIAL 2**

As a fresh graduate of  Biochemistry a similarity it has with the Design process is that to discover any breakthrough in science with direct impact on humans, research is carried out first to get necessary data on the subject of interest, then the next thing is to get a model organism that has a biologically similar to that of humans and then to finetune the conditions of the biological or chemical reagents etc that best brings a perfect outcome with is similar to the design process.

The next thing is to test lets say a drug on such organism and see its responsiveness either its ameliorates a disease if that's the aim of the research, then finally after validation and repeated testing its is produced in mass for the users in need.

UX Design simply refers to as User Experience Design, this encompasses the feelings of a user upon contact with any product be it a pen, an app, an elevator etc.

The major role or job description of a UX Designer is to build or design product that is easy for a user to use and get things done. the most important stakeholder in the eyes of a UX designer is the User that uses the said product and to make products that are  usable, enjoyable, and accessible for humans (users).

UX Design is different to other design fields in the sense that UX design is the  the overall experience and ease of a user in using a product to solve a particular problem while other design fields like UI design deals with the visual representation of a digital product aesthetics, the look and function while going through the product and also said to be the link between the
user and the functionality of a product, likewise Graphic design which focuses mainly on visual elements and not the entire interaction between a user and a product.
