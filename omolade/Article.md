#UI/UX FUNDAMENTALS

UI refers to User Interface while UX stands for User Experience, both are very important in building successful products and are closely related, a deficit in one is a deficit in the overall user experience which isn't ideal for a successful product is one isnt independent of the other.

Don Norman a Cognitive Scientist & User Experience Architect explains User Experience (UX) as encompassing all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products. 

It could be applied to anything the food we eat from a vendor, buying cars, furniture from dealers, a call to customer service operatives etc.

Essentially The “user experience” part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service. 

A UX Designer analyses and observes the performance of a user with a user with regards to the users ease in navigating around the product and also considering the ease of the user journey to solving a particular problem. 

User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, and building products that are useful, usable, desirable and accessible. UX designers don’t just focus on creating products that are usable; but also importance is placed on other aspects of the user experience, such as pleasure, efficiency and fun too. 

A UX designer ensures that the product logically flows from one step to the next as ‘‘Usability is the base of User Experience’’. 

Elements of a good User Experience (UX) design should be User Friendly. have a good usability design, great user design thorough user research such as  various kinds of research such as surveys. AB tests, focus groups, interviews, workshops, and more.

As a UX designer, the most important things to consider is the Why, What and How of product use. The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of the product. The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality.

 Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

Unlike the User experience which is all about how effective and enjoyable a product is to meet a consumer needs.

 User Interface encompasses the the whole feel of a product with respect to its looks, presentation, layout and level of Interaction like the touchpad on an ATM machine or the touchscreen of our phones.

The primary objective of a user interface design is to guide every user through a product via the use of buttons, typographies to create hierarchy, shapes, icons ,hovers, colors, scroll bars, slide bars etc and the transition between pages on a website or an app. User interfaces enable users to effectively control the computer or device upon which they get in contact with digital products. they are interacting with.

User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from \ information architecture, interaction design, and visual design.

Best Practices for designing an interfaces is to keep it simple, be consistent with the use of UI elements, using typography to create clarity and hierarchy etc.

 For a more holistic veiw UI can be said to be the animators controller, audio fixers 3D glass, game pad etc while UX is the feeling one gets when playing a good game like Aspalt or a more related example UX  is the feel when driving the car while UI is the car console.
