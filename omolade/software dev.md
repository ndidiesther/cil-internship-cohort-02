# SCRUM
Scrum is a sub set of Agile Methodology, it employs small group of people coming together to form a team for the sole purpose of building a successful product. The team usually consists of a product or project owner, a scrum master and a scrum team. 

Scrum software development starts with a features list commonly called the backlog and the features in the backlogs are ranked in order of importance, the most important is worked on first. Scrum uses an agile software development concept called sprint, sprints refers to the timeframe when software development is usually done, a sprint usually lasts for a week to a month to complete a single feature in the backlog.

A daily scrum meeting with the concerned team   usually lasts for about 15 minutes and they discuss what was done the previous day, what would be done the present day and if there was any obstacles, the cycle is repeated until the sprint review is done and then the next item on the backlog can then be worked on until the end of the product development these cycle continues.

## BENEFIT OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

1. It enables optimization of the development process by having a retrospective after each development, this helps by Examine how the just-completed sprint went as far as people, relationships, processes, and tools so as to improve things next time based on what was learnt.

2. Revewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.

3. It is dynamic and as such Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals without grave consequences

4. Each scrum sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market

5. Scrum promotes adapting to the rapid changing requirements as it comes and also creating and providing the estimates quickly.

6. It is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project.

7. It promotes team work and  team communication because the transfer of information during sprints and daily scrum meetings encourages collaboration between the team members to increase productivity.
