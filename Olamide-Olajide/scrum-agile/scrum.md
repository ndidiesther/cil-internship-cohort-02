# What I Understand By Scrum

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. The Scrum team assess progress in daily stand-up meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve. The scrum master guides the team and keeps them motivated.

Some benefits of Scrum in software development include

1. With Scrum programmers code “on the fly” and do not wait until all questions are answered and everything is crystal clear before they start to program. Everything is flexible and changeable during the life of the project and even after. The same is true of testing code which is constantly done and not just at the end after all coding has been completed.

2. With Scrum there is adaptability. Changes can be supported and integrated into a project currently in progress. 

3. With Scrum, tasks are prioritized by order of importance and this usually means that tasks to be completed first will probably affect return on investment the most.

4. Because a Scrum team have a Scrum Master who mentors and protects them from outside negative pressure, morale and job satisfaction is higher.

5. With Scrum there is greater customer/user satisfaction because users are getting useable portions of completed product quicker. They can then try out what they received and report back their findings. This is a critical factor in the overall success of the project.
