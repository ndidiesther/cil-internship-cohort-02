A layered process I am familiar with similar to the OSI model is the TCP/IP model.

The TCP/IP model provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into the four layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking. The four layers are:
- Application layer: provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.
- Transport layer: handles host-to-host communication.
- Internet layer: provides internetworking between independent networks.
- Link layer: contains communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment.

Through properly understanding each layerâ€™s function, you can either set out to exploit or secure information packets transmitted from one system to another.
