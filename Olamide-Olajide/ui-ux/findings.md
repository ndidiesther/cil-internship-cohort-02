# MY FINDINGS AFTER GOING THROUGH THE CAREERFOUNDRY TUTORIAL AND TAKING THE TESTS

I found out that though UX design as a field has been around for more than six decades, it is still emerging with different career paths sprouting over time.

As UX design is user-centred, a UX designer would have to know how to think like a user, and also be adept at user research. Also, companies who are UX oriented generally perform better than other companies who are not.

Aside hard skills, soft skills like communication, empathy and organization are also important skills for a UX designer to have. In addition, a design portfolio is very important for a UX designer as it shows one's skills and competencies.

Lastly, I found out the field of UX design contains people from different career backgrounds and there are different routes one can take to become a UX designer. These routes include:
- Self-study
- Non-mentored online courses
- Structured programs
