# UI/UX Fundamentals
UX design or user experience design is the process of discovering user needs and designing solutions to meet them. It is the art of carefully curating the experience a user will have when interacting with a certain product or service. While UI design, or user interface design, refers to designing visual user interfaces in software or computerized devices. It’s the overall design, the way in which information is presented, and how your users interact with your website. 
UX and UI are commonly used terms in the design world, but more often than not, they are incorrectly used as interchangeable terms. Although they work closely together and are both elements required in the design process, there are some distinct differences which we will see in there fundamentals.

## Basic fundamentals of UX design
Some basic fundamentals in UX designs are mentioned as follows;
1. ### Empathy
Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.
2. ### Strategy
Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process
3. ### Usability
In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. The last thing a user wants is to feel like ordering food delivery on their phone is equivalent to completing a 1000 piece puzzle. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.
4. ### Inclusivity
A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.
5. ### Validation
However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.

## Basic fundamentals of UI design
Just like UX design, UI designs have some basic fundamentals which are mentioned as follows;
1. ### Clarity
From recognizing interactive and static elements to making navigation intuitive, clarity is an essential part of a great UI design.
So when you create your product, ask yourself the following questions:
* Is your navigation intuitive? 
* Are users directed and encouraged to move from one page to the next with ease?
* Have you used highly visible buttons that prompt users into clicking them?
* Is the purpose of each element on your product, website or application, clear and easy to understand?
2. ### Familiarity
Do you automatically look for the menu at the top of the homepage of a new website?
Why? Because that’s where we perceive the menu to be. The best interfaces are familiar for users.
Usability, i.e. how easily a user interacts with a product or a website, is closely related to familiarity. Users depend on elements and interfaces acting in a way that’s familiar to their digital experience.
3. ### User Control
Place users in control of the interface. Jakob Nielsen explains why this is important: “Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked ‘emergency exit’ to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.”
This basically means giving users different options to go back a step when they feel they’ve made a mistake.
4. ### Hierarchy
Strong visual hierarchy is a core design principle of a successful user interface. It consists of arranging visual elements in a way that explains the level of importance of each element and guides users to take the desired action. As a designer, your job is to organize UI design elements in a way that makes it easy for users to navigate within your product.
Visual hierarchy creates an order of importance to visual elements in order to direct a user’s attention and make information easier to consume.
It ensures that users see the most important information first, then the next, and so on, and is established through various elements. Some of them include; color, size, fonts.
5. ### Negative space
Give your elements some breathing room - don’t cram all the objects and elements together on the screen. Negative space makes important elements pop and stand out.
As Nick Kampouris, User Experience & User Interface Designer, advises, “Social distance your elements, text blocks and everything on your darn screen. Space is everyone's friend. Use the Law of Proximity to help users visually navigate your pages. This is as much a part of your design than everything else so please mind the gap.”
6. ### Flexibility
Flexibility doesn’t just follow a linear path, it’s about knowing your customers and giving flexibility for different customer intents. So from designing solutions that work great in all situations to using shortcuts that speed up interaction for users, flexibility is a key principle of user interface design.
You not only need to make your user interface learnable for new users, but it should also have accelerators that help expert users speed up their processes. From novices to experts, ensure your product is flexible and efficient for all kinds of users.
7. ###  Accessibility
Designing your website for all users is essential. When designing products and websites, make sure that you meet the requirements of WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
Some easy ways to incorporate the principle of accessibility while designing products are:
* Use the WebAim Color Contrast checker to create strong color contrasts.
* Ensure all your images have corresponding alt attributes.
* Ask yourself if users can easily navigate your website via the tab key on your keyboard.

# Concluding thoughts
UI/UX designs are necesaasry for a successful product development. One cannot function without the other.They work closely together and are both elements required in the design process. Good UI/UX designs increases the likelihood of loyal customers, increase the chances that they will complete targeted goals and directed actions.
